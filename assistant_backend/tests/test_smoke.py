"""
Broad, shallow sweep: does each router's list endpoint respond without a
server error, for a brand-new workspace that legitimately has zero items of
that type yet? This is the fast "is anything obviously broken" signal --
depth (real CRUD, real assertions) belongs in test_core_flow.py instead.

Endpoints deliberately left out, with why:
  - /api/v1/workspaces/{id}/settings/  -- GET / assumes a UserSettings row
    already exists for the caller; a fresh signup may not have one yet.
    Needs its own investigation (does signup create one, or does GET need
    a get-or-create fallback?), not a blind smoke check that would just
    report a status with no context.
  - /timeblocks -- timeblock_controller.py's GET/PUT/DELETE routes are
    missing the /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id} prefix that POST has, so
    workspace_id is silently a required *query* param instead of a path
    param. Flagging as a known inconsistency rather than guessing the
    intended fix.
  - comments -- no plain list route exists (only /{comment_id} and
    /tasks/{task_id}); nothing equivalent to smoke-test here.
