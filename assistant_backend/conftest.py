"""
Runs against the real local Postgres (the same 'productify' DB docker-compose
brings up) rather than a mocked DB or a separate async test DB.

Why: the whole app is synchronous (plain SQLAlchemy Session + psycopg2), not
async — handlers each open their own SessionLocal() bound to a single
module-level engine created at import time from config.database_url. That
means DATABASE_URL can't be swapped per-test via env vars or FastAPI
dependency overrides (most routers don't even use Depends(get_db) — they
instantiate handlers directly, which bind to the real engine themselves).
A previous version of this file tried an async engine against a separate
'postgres' database with asyncpg; that dependency was never installed in
the image and the paths didn't match anything real. See PROGRESS notes for
the case-sensitivity bug in config.py (Settings.Config.case_sensitive=True
against lowercase field names) that makes DB_* env-var overrides silently
no-op — that's why "point tests at a separate DB via env var" isn't a
realistic option right now without fixing that first.

Tradeoff accepted deliberately: init_db() (drop_all + create_all) runs once
per test session for a clean slate, and every test creates its own
uniquely-emailed user, so tests don't collide with each other or with
whatever the interactive dev backend currently has in the DB. Don't run
this against a database that has real data you care about.

Schema creation is Alembic's job in the app itself now (main.py's startup
event no longer calls init_db() -- see PROGRESS notes on why rebuilding the
schema on every app boot was actively destructive). Tests still want a full
disposable reset, so this file calls init_db() directly instead of relying
on it happening as a side effect of app startup.
